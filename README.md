Hi, welcome to nVision!

Our project is aimed to help spread scientific articles by setting up a platform for summaries of these articles.

# How it works
First you need to run "flask run" in the terminal and click on the link it gives you.

If you don't have an account, it's pretty straight foward. You can use our search bar to look for either the PMID or the article name or a key word.
You should get a list of results and you can click on any one of these and read the summaries.
You can also refer to the link at the bottom of the summary to see the original article.
You can also request articles if you want, and eventually someone else will write a summary, it will be reviewed, and it will be available for you to read.

If you have an account all these features are available, plus more.
You will be able to like and dislike articles, and this will be displayed.
In the "contribute" section, you will be able to review and summarize articles. If you summarize an article, you will submit it.
Once you submit it, three users will have to review and approve it, before it is available in the browse section.
You can also review articles that are up on review.
You will be able to see your profile page and see your "progess": how many articles you have contributed to.
You can also change the password to your account.
