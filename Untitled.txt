The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) in the US was reported from Washington
State on January 31, 2020.

Soon after, Washington and
California reported outbreaks, and cases in the US have now
exceeded total cases reported in both Italy and China. The rate
of infections in New York, with its high population density,
has exceeded every other state, and, as of April 20, 2020, it
has more than 30% of all of the US cases.
Limited information has been available to describe the
presenting characteristics and outcomes of US patients
requiring hospitalization with this illness. In a retrospective 
cohort study from China, hospitalized patients were predominantly men with a median age of 56 years; 26% required

intensive care unit (ICU) care, and there was a 28% mortality
rate. However, there are significant differences between
China and the US in population demographics,5 smoking
rates,6 and prevalence of comorbidities.

This study describes the demographics, baseline comorbidities, presenting clinical tests, and outcomes of the first sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from an academic health care system in New York.
