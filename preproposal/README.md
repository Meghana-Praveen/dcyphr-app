# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to create a web application that allows people to collaborate on decoding scientific articles.
These decoded articles should be stored in a database that will be accessible to anyone on the web.
The application should allow for people to contribute articles, get paid for their contribution and
also browse articles.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I plan to collaborate with Isabela Cardenas. Her section leaders are Ileana and Yoyo. I also plan to
collaborate with Roxanne Nesbitt. Her section leaders are Emily and Tanushree.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Will we get feedback on the feasability of our project before we submit a formal proposal?
