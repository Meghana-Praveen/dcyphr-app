Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We have doen the distribution code and have figured out some of the routes. Some of it works right now, and the tables are set up and running.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have some general questions about search bar, browsing and organizing data. That will get solved this week, hopefully with help at OH.
We also need update the review route.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

 We dont know how to make a very general html that can take input from python if it has already been rendered.
 Just linking htmls together and making sure information comes through.
