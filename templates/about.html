<p class="name1">The purpose of science is to explain the natural world to us. However, in the status quo, the knowledge and tools of science
is limited to a select few that have the resources to learn it. The language in scientific articles is unnecessarily complex
and full of jargon. This makes it hard even for those that have the education to keep up with the literature.</p>
<p class="name1">Thus, <b>dcyphr</b>: an open-source platform that makes science more accessible to the public.</p>
